- 👋 Hi, I’m @tiva7 from Europe!
- 👀 I’m interested in software architecture, AI for Good, music (I play the piano), books, photography, comics, social impact, walking, and desserts 🍰
- 🌱 I worked as a Software Engineer in a consulting company, currently studying how to leverage technology for good purpose.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on more social impact projects. I'd like to use my tech skills in creating and developing applications that address current social issues (i.e EdTech and Clean Tech)
- 💡 I am starting to use this repo in order to improve my skills while trying to make the planet a better place (I know, not an easy quest but we need a starting point)
